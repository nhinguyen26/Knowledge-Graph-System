# Knowledge-Graph-System

## Overview
This repository contains key components of the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) system, designed for multi-hop reasoning over a knowledge graph. The system is built with a focus on embedding-based techniques to enable sophisticated question answering.

### Files Included:

-documentation.md: Detailed documentation of the project's architecture, design decisions, and methods.
-README.md: This file, explaining the project and its structure.
-processing_notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and data manipulation.
-question_Embedding_module/: Code for embedding questions into vector representations for further reasoning.
-answer_selection.py: Script for selecting the correct answer from the set of candidate answers.
-question_answer.py: Main pipeline for processing the question and retrieving the answer.
-documentation.md: Detailed documentation of the project's architecture, design decisions, and methods.

### Other files:
Due to file size constraints, some larger files such as the dataset, trained models, and additional assets are not included in this repository. These files are necessary to fully run the project but can be made available upon request 

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project, please refer to the documentation.md. This includes system requirements, data preparation steps, and a guide to executing the pipeline.
